# About HolyNet

## Digital Map of Pilgrimage Routes in Post-Crusader Palestine

HolyNet is a searchable, interactive map worked out in the frame of the SNSF-Advanced Grant project Holy Networks. Locating, Shaping, and Experiencing Palestinian Loca Sancta (1187-1852). It systematically records the location, historical vicissitudes, and experiential dimension of the holy sites that came to be identified as material indicators of holy persons and sacred narratives by different Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities in post-Crusader Palestine. Furthermore, it explores their interconnectedness by reconstructing, also via 3D interactive panoramas, the topographic networks shaped by the kinetic experience of premodern pilgrims who visited the loca sancta along pre-established paths.
